# GEoFF - Games Everyone Finds Fun.

## Introduction
GEoFF a project to provide a custom lightweight HTML and WebSocket server, built using the powerful Boost::beast library.

It's inspired by [Vinnie Falco “Get rich quick! Using Boost.Beast WebSockets and Networking TS”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FQwAjELMek), because who doesn't want to get rich quick?  I know I do. 

WebSockets provide session based, 2-way, real-time communication between a web client and server.  The Boost::beast libary is well suited to provide a very lightweight multiplayer game server for HTML 5 games written in JavaScript that will large numbers of players simultaneously.  GEoFF is NOT another Apache, IIS, or nginx.  It's designed to support multiplayer web games, and nothing else.

Stay tuned for progress!
